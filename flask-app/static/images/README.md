# Bluez PowerHouse Logo Setup

## Instructions for Adding the Professional Logo

1. **Save the logo image** you provided as `bluez-powerhouse-logo.png` in this directory (`flask-app/static/images/`)

2. **Image Requirements:**
   - **Format:** PNG (recommended for transparency and quality)
   - **Recommended size:** 400x300px or similar aspect ratio
   - **Background:** Transparent or white background
   - **Quality:** High resolution for crisp display

3. **File name must be exactly:** `bluez-powerhouse-logo.png`

## Current Logo Integration

The professional Bluez PowerHouse logo has been integrated into:

- ✅ **Header Logo** - Main website navigation (20x16 container)
- ✅ **Footer Logo** - Footer section with white invert filter (16x12 container) 
- ✅ **Admin Sidebar Logo** - Management system sidebar (14x11 container)

## Fallback System

If the logo image doesn't load, each location has a styled fallback with "B.P.H" text to ensure the site remains functional.

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use PNG format for best quality and transparency support
- Optimize file size while maintaining quality (use tools like TinyPNG)
- Ensure the logo is clearly visible on both light and dark backgrounds
- The footer version uses CSS filters to make it white for dark backgrounds

Once you place the `bluez-powerhouse-logo.png` file in this directory, the logo will automatically appear throughout the website!
